Project Overview

This project analyzes data on children living in low-income households in London, broken down by boroughs and wards over 8 years (2014â€“2021). The analysis addresses the following questions:

Borough-Level Summary Table: Generate a table that shows the mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum number of children in low-income homes across all wards in each borough.
Exclude Unusual Boroughs: Exclude the following boroughs from further analysis: City of London, Kensington and Chelsea, Kingston upon Thames, Richmond upon Thames, and Westminster.
Visualization by Year: Create a plot showing the distribution of children in low-income homes by year, along with visual representations of the mean and standard deviation.
T-Test Comparison: Perform a t-test to compare the distribution of children living in low-income homes between the earliest (2014) and latest (2021) years.
